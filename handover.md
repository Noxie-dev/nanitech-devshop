## 4. Available Scripts

To manage the project, navigate to the `nanitech-devshop` directory in your terminal and use the following `pnpm` commands:

-   **`pnpm install`**: Installs all project dependencies.
-   **`pnpm run dev`**: Starts the development server with hot-reloading. Accessible typically at `http://localhost:5173/`.
-   **`pnpm run build`**: Compiles the application for production deployment. The output will be in the `dist/` directory.
-   **`pnpm run lint`**: Lints the codebase for potential errors and style inconsistencies.
-   **`pnpm run preview`**: Serves the production build locally for testing.

## 5. How It Was Implemented

1.  **Project Initialization:** A React project was scaffolded using `manus-create-react-app` (which uses Vite internally).
2.  **Styling Setup:** Tailwind CSS was integrated and configured for utility-first styling. Custom CSS for glassmorphic effects and gradients was added to `App.css`.
3.  **Core Components Development:**
    -   **`Navigation.jsx`**: Created for site navigation.
    -   **`HeroSection.jsx`**: Developed with `framer-motion` for animations and a custom `CircuitBackground.jsx` for the interactive background. The NANI TECH logo and text effects were carefully styled.
    -   **`ServicesSection.jsx`**: Designed with individual service cards, icons from `lucide-react`, and responsive layouts.
    -   **`ProjectsSection.jsx`**: Implemented to showcase projects with filtering capabilities and visually appealing project cards.
    -   **`AboutSection.jsx`**: Created to detail company stats, mission, vision, values, and team members with social links.
    -   **`BlogSection.jsx`**: Designed as a CMS-ready blog with search and category filtering, using placeholder data for now.
    -   **`BookingSection.jsx`**: A form for clients to book demos/meetings, including various input fields and a simulated submission process.
    -   **`ContactSection.jsx`**: A comprehensive contact form with contact information, social links, and an FAQ section.
    -   **`Footer.jsx`**: A detailed footer with navigation links, contact info, social media, and a newsletter signup.
4.  **Supabase Integration:** A `supabase.js` file was created in `src/lib/` to initialize the Supabase client. Placeholder API calls are present in `BookingSection.jsx` and `BlogSection.jsx` to demonstrate where actual Supabase interactions would occur.
5.  **Error Handling & Refinement:** During development, issues with component rendering were debugged by temporarily commenting out sections and re-introducing them to isolate the problem. The `framer-motion` dependency was explicitly added to ensure smooth animations.
6.  **Deployment:** The application was built for production using `pnpm run build` and deployed as a static frontend using `service_deploy_frontend`.

## 6. What Needs to Be Done (Order of Importance)

1.  **Supabase Backend Implementation (High Priority):**
    -   **Database Schema:** Define and implement the actual database schemas in Supabase for:
        -   **Blog Posts:** `posts` table (id, title, slug, excerpt, content, author, featured_image, tags, published, created_at, read_time, category).
        -   **Booking Requests:** `bookings` table (id, name, email, phone, company, serviceType, projectDescription, preferredDate, preferredTime, budgetRange, created_at, status).
        -   **Contact Form Submissions:** `contacts` table (id, name, email, subject, message, created_at, status).
        -   **Newsletter Subscriptions:** `subscribers` table (id, email, created_at).
    -   **API Integration:** Replace the simulated API calls in `src/lib/supabase.js`, `BookingSection.jsx`, `BlogSection.jsx`, and `ContactSection.jsx` with actual Supabase client calls to interact with the defined tables.
    -   **Authentication (Optional but Recommended):** Implement user authentication for a CMS dashboard if a custom one is desired for managing blog posts.

2.  **CMS for Blog (High Priority):**
    -   **Headless CMS Integration:** Integrate a headless CMS (e.g., Strapi, Sanity, Contentful) if a more robust content management solution is preferred over direct Supabase table editing. This would involve setting up the CMS, defining content models, and connecting it to Supabase or using its own database.
    -   **Blog Post Detail Pages:** Create dynamic routes and components to display individual blog posts based on their `slug`.

3.  **Booking System Backend Logic (High Priority):**
    -   **Email Notifications:** Set up email notifications for both the client (confirmation) and the dev shop (new booking request) upon form submission.
    -   **Calendar Integration:** Integrate with a calendar service (e.g., Google Calendar API, Calendly API) to allow clients to directly book available slots and for the dev shop to manage appointments.

4.  **Contact Form Backend Logic (Medium Priority):**
    -   **Email Forwarding:** Configure the contact form to send emails to a designated dev shop email address.
    -   **Spam Protection:** Implement reCAPTCHA or similar measures to prevent spam submissions.

5.  **Project Details Pages (Medium Priority):**
    -   Create individual pages for each project in the portfolio to provide more in-depth information, case studies, and visual assets.

6.  **SEO Optimization (Medium Priority):**
    -   Implement meta tags, structured data, and sitemaps for better search engine visibility.
    -   Optimize images and other assets for faster loading times.

7.  **Accessibility (Medium Priority):**
    -   Ensure the website adheres to WCAG guidelines for accessibility, including proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.

8.  **Performance Optimization (Medium Priority):**
    -   Further optimize image loading (e.g., lazy loading, WebP format).
    -   Code splitting and bundle analysis for smaller initial load sizes.

9.  **Testing (Medium Priority):**
    -   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for React components and utility functions.
    -   **Integration Tests:** Test the flow between different components and API integrations.
    -   **End-to-End Tests:** Use tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user interactions across the entire website.

10. **Analytics Integration (Low Priority):**
    -   Integrate Google Analytics or other tracking tools to monitor website traffic and user behavior.
