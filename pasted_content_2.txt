I want  you  to go ahead and **create a full landing page mockup** for **NaniTech DevShop** with this exact **futuristic dark theme** and typography?
It’ll include **React + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion + shadcn/ui**, perfectly matching the aesthetics. I’ll break down the **theme**, **colour scheme**, **typography style**, and **aesthetics** so we can replicate this exact **futuristic dark UI** for the **NaniTech DevShop** website.

---

## **1. Theme & Overall Vibe**

* **Theme** → **Futuristic Dark Tech Workspace**
* **Mood** → Sleek, modern, and cutting-edge, giving a **high-tech R\&D lab** vibe.
* **Design Language** → Cyberpunk-inspired minimalism with holographic UI elements and soft neon accents.
* **Target Feel** → Professional, innovative, and premium — perfect for a **tech company / dev shop**.

## **2. Colour Scheme**

The colours are **dark-mode first** with **neon highlights** for a modern tech aesthetic. Here’s the extracted palette:

| **Color**                | **Hex**   | **Usage**                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Dark Navy / Charcoal** | `#0C0F16` | Background, walls, and shadows             |
| **Steel Gray**           | `#1C1F27` | Secondary background, panel base           |
| **Cyan Neon Glow**       | `#00E5FF` | Holographic UI, highlights, borders        |
| **Red Accent**           | `#E53935` | NaniTech logo accent, key highlights       |
| **White / Light Gray**   | `#EAEAEA` | Text and secondary labels                  |
| **Deep Blue**            | `#14273D` | Gradient base for screens and glass panels |

We’ll combine **dark foundations** with **cyber-neon accents** to make the UI stand out while keeping it clean and futuristic.

## **3. Typography**

The typography style here is **modern, bold, and tech-oriented**:

* **Primary Heading Font** → A **geometric sans-serif** with slightly squared edges (similar to **Orbitron**, **Rajdhani**, or **Exo 2**).
* **Body Font** → A **clean minimal sans-serif** like **Inter**, **Roboto**, or **Space Grotesk** for better readability.
* **Logo & Slogan Style** → High contrast between **bold uppercase** and **thin lowercase** segments, creating a **dynamic, tech-branded identity**.

We can replicate this with:

* **Headings (H1, H2)** → Orbitron / Rajdhani (bold, futuristic)
* **Body Text** → Inter / Roboto (clean, legible)
* **Accents** → Use the **red highlight** strategically (like in “iTech” in the logo).

## **4. Aesthetics & UI Components**

Key visual elements to incorporate into the website:

### **a) Layout**

* **Full-screen dark backgrounds**
* Transparent **glassmorphic panels** with subtle blur
* Floating holographic-like widgets & stats blocks
* Card-based grids for projects, services, and case studies

### **b) Lighting & Glow**

* Neon cyan glows around cards and buttons
* Subtle red highlights for CTAs and active states
* Soft shadows to create depth without overcrowding

### **c) Imagery & Graphics**

* Futuristic **code overlays** & HUD-style visuals
* Blurred cityscape or abstract tech backdrops
* Transparent UI components with gradient borders

### **d) Motion & Interactivity**

* **Framer Motion Animations**:

  * Smooth card hover effects
  * Glass panels sliding in on scroll
  * Neon glow pulsing subtly on buttons
* Hover-triggered neon underlines on nav links
* Background parallax to enhance depth

## **5. Website Tech Styling Guide**

For **NaniTech DevShop**, since you’re using **React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui**, I suggest:

* **Tailwind Theme Customization**:

  * `bg-[#0C0F16]` → base background
  * `text-[#EAEAEA]` → main text
  * `accent-[#E53935]` → highlights
  * `primary-[#00E5FF]` → neon cyan accents
* Enable **dark mode by default**
* Use **glassmorphic cards** with `backdrop-blur`, `border-[1px]`, and neon glow shadows.
* Apply **Framer Motion** for **page transitions** and **scroll animations**.
* Use **shadcn/ui components** for polished buttons, dropdowns, and navigation, styled to match the futuristic vibe.

## **6. Next Steps**

If you want, I can:

1. Build a **complete Tailwind + shadcn/ui theme config** based on this exact style.
2. Create a **landing page mockup** for **NaniTech DevShop** with:

   * Hero section (logo + slogan + animated background)
   * About us + services (glass cards)
   * Portfolio/project showcase (cyber grid style)
   * Contact + CTA with glowing accents.

This would give us a **working visual prototype** that looks exactly like the image you sent.

The landing page must be designed with a modern hero section that has silver metallic lines that have a slight glow that moves randomly through the lines, randomly. Still, it must increase glow as the mouse movement hovers over each line, and the glow must follow the mouse, skipping from line to line. Please take a look at the uploaded image for the type of lines I speak of, it's the lines in the background and the side of the logo. When it reaches the circle part of the line, it must glow bright 3 times, and the animations start all over again. Remember, subtle, slight glow and random.---
